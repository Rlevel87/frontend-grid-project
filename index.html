                             I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                              amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! 
                              I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of 
                              my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a

                        <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed 
                            some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by 
                            step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only 
                            say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did 
                            not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for 
                            assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took 
                            my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
                            In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my 
                            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack 
                            developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
